While global inference is widely\\nused, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,\\nis rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of\\ndispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction\\nmethod, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive\\nmodeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers.

        "Between BiLSTM and Bert-Base, both exploit pre-trained embeddings. The simpler neural architecture and all combinations in section 1 proved to be less efficient than Bert-Base, however, the performance of BiLSTM is very close to transformers. Bert showed clear signs of overfitting in the early stages, the reduction of the learning rate resulted in slower learning, longer times and no significant improvement. The BiLSTM model performed significantly better than all the solutions in section 1 and almost at Bert-Base levels. This method shows great potential, but is hardly scalable and lacks the generalisation provided by large language models; it is therefore interesting to observe it with respect to large language models, but should not be preferred given its size."
